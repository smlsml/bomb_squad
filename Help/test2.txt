*BASIC IDEA*
 Mark\Disable all the bombs on the board before time runs out to move
 on to the next level.
 
*REVEAL SQUARES*
-What
 :Reveal the board until an intelligent decision can be made on where
  the bombs are possibly located.  

-HowTo:
:Left click to reveal squares.
:They will only reveal on release of button, to allow user to hop 
 to different squares while still holding.

-Outcome
:Upon revealing a square there will either be a number, nothing, or a bomb.
 >Nothing : No bomb, will open board till a bomb is detected
 >Number  : The number of bombs are present in the adjacent squares
 >Bomb    : Sorry pal your dead. Try again

:Depending on the numbers you will see, make decisions on where bombs could 
 be and mark those squares.  

*MARK SQUARES*
-What
:Marking where you think a bomb is placed.

-HowTo
:Right click to mark a bomb.
:Right click a marked square to unmark it.
 
-Outcome
:If all bombs are marked, you will advance to the next level automatically.
:If all marks are used but you don't advance then at least one of your 
 marks is wrong.

*AUTO-OPEN* 
-What
:If the surrounding squares contain as many marks as the numbered square 
 predicts then the area is eligible for auto opening

-HowTo
:Left click and hold on a square which has a number inside.
 Then hold the right button.

-Outcome
:This will cause all adjacent squares to turn either: 
 >Blue: Squares are marked or uneligible for auto opening
 >Red : Square is eligible for auto opening
 >None: Already open
